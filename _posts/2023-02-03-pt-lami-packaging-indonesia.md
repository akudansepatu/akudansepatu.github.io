**PT Lami Packaging Indonesia (Lamipak)** is a producer of high quality aseptic packaging that provides the best value solutions to its customers. Initially set up to mass produce paper based packages for the beverage and food industries. It was only until 2007 when the Lamipak brand formally came into existence and was granted funding to construct a manufacturing facility dedicated to aseptic packaging.
